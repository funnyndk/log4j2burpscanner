## 4.Why can't some sites be detected？
### 0x01 Sometimes, because too many request headers are added, the server processes the request too slowly or cannot respond. You can control it by controlling the request header parameters, as shown in the following settings
#### isuseUserAgentTokenXff=0(whether test User-agent、token、X-Forward-for、X-Client-IP)
#### isuseXfflists=0(whether test xff lists，including others xff)
#### isuseAllCookie=0(whether test all cookie)

### 0x02 Due to the problems of network environment and dnslog, the request cannot be responded in time. You can try to replace the custom dnslog platform

### 0x03 If it is not the above reasons and the scan request package is not seen in the logger, you can submit the issue
